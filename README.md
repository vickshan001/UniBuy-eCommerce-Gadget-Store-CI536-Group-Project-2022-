# 💸 UniBuy – Gadget Price Comparison Platform (CI536 Group Project, 2022)

**UniBuy** is a responsive price comparison web application developed as a group project for the **CI536 module** in 2021. The platform allows users to browse laptops, desktops, and mobile devices, and compare product prices across different online retailers — showing which store offers the best deal.

I contributed to this project by:

- 🔧 Developing the **PHP backend** that fetches and processes real-time price data.
- 🎨 Integrating and managing **frontend input functionality** for dynamic interaction and product comparison.
